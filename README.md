## What's inside 
There are two implementations `vanilla` and [`comlink`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink). First one is vanilla JS approach while the latter one shows how to use it with TS in a more promise-like way.
## 1- Vanilla Web Worker 🚲

Use `vanilla-step1` to practice, and `vanilla-step2` to inspect implementation 
#### Where is worker
👀 -> `public/long-runner.js`

## 2- Comlink and TS 🚗
Use `comlink-step1` to practice, and `comlink-step2` to inspect implementation 
#### Where is worker
👀 -> `src/workers/long-runner/long-runner.ts`

## How to start
`yarn & yarn start`
